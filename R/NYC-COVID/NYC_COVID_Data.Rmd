This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

1. take existing data from spreadsheets
2. take new simple data from typed entry
3. take new complex data (sewershed) from documents in the folder
4. normalize data
5. update charts


```{r setup}
require(tidyverse) # for reading and parsing
require(tcltk) # for file choosing
require(here) # for file choosing
```

# Input
The Sample Data folder contains examples of files in the correct format.

. an existing csv with data fitting the format
. sewershed data from CDC
. case, positivity, and hospitalization data from NYC

```{r choose data file}

```

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
